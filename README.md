CV Lab assignment

This repository contains the code & deliverables for the CV Assignment "Lost in Pieces: Jigsaw puzzle" for the course Computer Vision 2025-2026 at the University of Piraeus.

## Description
The goal of this assignment is to reconstruct a jigsaw puzzle from its pieces using computer vision techniques. The project involves image processing, feature extraction, and matching techniques to accurately piece together the puzzle generated by cutting an image into smaller segments, rotating them & randomly shuffling them.

## Requirements
- Python 3.13 or higher

For this Project we use the UV package manager for Python.
Ruff is also used for formatting and linting.
To install UV, follow the instructions on the [official UV website](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

Once UV is installed, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:
